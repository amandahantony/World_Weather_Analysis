# World_Weather_Analysis

### Purpose 
The purpose of this World Weather Analysis project is to provide the user with travel destinations based on their ideal minimum and maximum temperatures. The PlanMyTrip App will filter through data from around the world based on the user's weather preferences and provide potential travel destinations and nearby hotels along with the maximum temperature and current weather description. 

## Deliverable 1: Weather Database
In the first section, we generated a set of 2000 random latitudes and longitudes. We then performed an API call with the OpenWeatherMap to retrieve various cities across the world and their coordinates. A dataframe was created to show each city, it's country, latitude, longitude, max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed and weather description (as shown below).
